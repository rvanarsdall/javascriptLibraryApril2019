// FUNCTIONS!

// functions take some input which the function will handle/process
// they will process the input given to them
// usually but not always return some value
// they can be invoked (used) as may times as we want


function newFunc(num){
    return num +1
}

newFunc(7)
console.log(newFunc(7))

function sentence(firstName, lastName) {
 return `My first name is ${firstName} and my last name is ${lastName}`
